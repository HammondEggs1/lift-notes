LiftNnotes is a workout tracking/journaling app that seeks to provide a more dynamic and flexible solution to the problem of remembering how many reps, sets, and weight you did and the most recent time you did that specific workout in order to aid in the progressive overload process. The app relies on a note taking interface with predictive text that remembers your previous workouts and includes graphs of your weight over time.
